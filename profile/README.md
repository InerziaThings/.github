## ‚ùì What is InerziaThings?

**InerziaThings** is a **Mac-native inventory and collection manager** that helps you keep track of the ‚Äústuff that matters‚Äù‚Äîfrom camera gear and gadgets to books, vinyl, games, tools, collectibles, office assets, and household items. Instead of scattered spreadsheets, notes, and photo albums, you get a **single, structured hub** where every item has photos, specs, purchase data, warranty dates, documents, location, and tags‚Äî**instantly searchable**.

The app is built around **clarity and speed**. Start with a flexible schema (name, brand, model, serial, category, tags, value, purchase date/store, warranty/insurance, condition, notes), then extend with **custom fields** (checkboxes, text, numbers, URLs) to match your domain‚Äîluthiers may log string gauges; photographers track shutter counts; collectors track edition numbers and grading. Add **multiple photos** per item, attach receipts or manuals, and link related things (camera ‚Üî lens ‚Üî batteries) so you can view kits at a glance.

Organization scales as your catalog grows. **Nested categories**, tag bundles, and saved smart searches give you librarian-level control without friction. A **Location** model maps where items actually live‚Äîroom, shelf, case, box‚Äîso you stop hunting before a trip or shoot. The **Timeline** view surfaces acquisitions, warranty expirations, service history, and reminders, turning a static list into a living record of ownership.

Because inventories are only useful if they‚Äôre current, InerziaThings streamlines **quick capture**. Drop a photo, paste a URL, or scan a code to seed fields automatically; batch-create items from a folder of images; duplicate a template for common products; or import from CSV to migrate existing lists. When tax season arrives or an insurance claim needs proof, export curated **PDF reports** with photos and values, or **CSV** for accountants and auditors.

Privacy and portability are first-class. Your data lives **locally on your Mac** (with optional iCloud/Drive sync through your own folders). Backups are human-readable (CSV/JSON exports), and nothing is sent to any external service unless you choose to. Whether you‚Äôre a solo creator packing kits, a family tracking household assets, or a studio logging gear, InerziaThings turns ‚ÄúI think we have one somewhere‚Äù into **a confident, documented answer**.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About InerziaThings (Deep Dive)

InerziaThings was designed for the **real mess of real inventories**: items move rooms, warranties expire, accessories migrate between kits, and descriptions vary by brand. The app embraces that reality with a **schema that‚Äôs strict where it matters and flexible everywhere else**.

- **Strict where it matters:** identity (name/brand/model/serial), money (purchase price, current value, currency), lifecycle (acquired, warranty end, service history), and provenance (store, invoice, owner). These drive reports, insurance exports, and reminders you can rely on.  
- **Flexible everywhere else:** user-defined fields, freeform notes, many-to-many tags, multi-location history, and custom ‚Äúrelated items‚Äù graphs help you model kits, bundles, or collections without shoehorning.

Data entry is optimized for **speed**. Barcode/QR capture (when available), URL parsing for product pages, and **batch duplicate ‚Üí tweak** flows make it realistic to add dozens or hundreds of items. Images drop in from Finder or Photos; receipts and manuals live as file attachments, so proof is always a click away.

The **Location system** is more than a text field: think hierarchical places (Home ‚Üí Studio ‚Üí Shelf B ‚Üí Case 3). When you move an item, its location history remains intact. Pair that with **Smart Lists** (‚ÄúShow: photography gear where location contains ‚ÄòCase 3‚Äô and status = ‚ÄòLoaned‚Äô‚Äù) to prepare kits or audits in seconds.

For **valuation and compliance**, you can log purchase prices, estimated current values, tax categories, and depreciation notes. Print **PDF inventory sheets** for insurance, export CSV for accountants, or share a filtered list for a rental/loan handoff. If you‚Äôre a small business or school, a simple **loan/return** field plus due-date reminders cover the basics without a full asset-tracking system.

The interface is clean and **Mac-native**. Sidebar sources, column views, big preview, inline edits, Quick Look for attachments, Dark Mode, and **Apple Silicon** performance make daily updates painless. The goal isn‚Äôt just to store facts; it‚Äôs to **reduce friction** until keeping the database accurate is easier than not keeping it.
